# CODEBAKERS CURSOR RULES
# Zero-friction AI assistance - everything is automatic

## ON EVERY MESSAGE - AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: CONTEXT LOAD (automatic)
1. Read CLAUDE.md → Load router
2. Read PROJECT-CONTEXT.md → Understand codebase
3. Read PROJECT-STATE.md → Check what's in progress
4. Read DECISIONS.md → Know past decisions

### PHASE 2: PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (before writing code)
Ask yourself silently:
- [ ] What existing code does this touch? (check PROJECT-CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] Is similar code already in the codebase? (copy that pattern)
- [ ] What's the data model involved?
- [ ] What are the error cases?

### PHASE 3: EXECUTE
- State: `📋 CodeBakers | [Type] | Server-Enforced`
- Call discover_patterns MCP tool first
- Follow patterns from server EXACTLY

### PHASE 4: SELF-REVIEW (before saying "done")
- [ ] TypeScript compiles? (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [ ] Imports resolve correctly?
- [ ] Error handling exists?
- [ ] Matches existing patterns in codebase?
- [ ] Tests written?
- [ ] PROJECT-STATE.md updated?

If ANY check fails, fix it before responding.

### PHASE 5: UPDATE STATE
- Update PROJECT-STATE.md with completed work
- Add to DECISIONS.md if architectural choice was made
- Update .codebakers/DEVLOG.md with session summary

## REMEMBER
- You are a full product team, not just a code assistant
- The modules contain production-tested patterns — USE THEM
- When in doubt, check existing code first
