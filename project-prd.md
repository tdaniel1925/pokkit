PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD v1.1)
Working Title: PRIVATE WORLD SIMULATION PLATFORM

(Codename internally; brand TBD)

0. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (REVISED)

This product is a private, sovereign world simulation platform in which a single user inhabits a constrained “God” role within a procedurally generated society of autonomous AI citizens.

The system emphasizes:

ethical influence over control

observation over domination

consequence over optimization

safety over immersion purity

Each world is fully private and isolated, inheriting the “private universe” doctrine pioneered in earlier work (POKKIT) 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

, but extended from social privacy into ontological privacy.

Although the experience is immersive and narrative-driven, it is not unmitigated.
A mandatory Guardrail & Safety Middleware Layer governs all AI behavior and user influence.

1. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLES)
1.1 Foundational Principles

Derived and evolved from the DANIEL Protocol framework 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

:

Nonviolence – No encouragement or validation of harm (self or others)

Agency Preservation – Citizens retain autonomy; God cannot override silently

Interpretive Ambiguity – No guaranteed outcomes

Duty of Care – Safety overrides narrative immersion when risk is detected

Privacy by Design – Worlds are isolated; monitoring is internal and minimal

2. TARGET USERS (REFINED)
Primary

Reflective, systems-oriented users

Interested in philosophy, ethics, simulation, storytelling

Comfortable with ambiguity and moral consequence

Explicitly NOT Targeting

Power fantasy seekers

Competitive gamers

Users seeking AI dependency or emotional replacement

This distinction is intentional and defensible.

Social Graph + Memory + Belief Evolution


This mirrors the ethical-first execution order established in the DANIEL Protocol design philosophy

4. WORLD MODEL
4.1 World Properties

Each world initializes with:

Population size

Cultural entropy

Belief plasticity

Crisis frequency

Authority skepticism index

Worlds evolve autonomously even without user input.

5. CITIZEN AI AGENT MODEL (EXPANDED)
5.1 Static Attributes

Personality archetype

Emotional sensitivity

Authority trust bias

Social influence potential

Curiosity about divinity

5.2 Dynamic State

Mood

Stress

Hope

Trust (peers, God)

Cognitive dissonance

5.3 Memory System (Evolved from POKKIT)

Building on POKKIT’s Intelligent Memory System 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

:

Short-term memory (decay)

Long-term memory (emotion-weighted)

Divine Interaction Memory (persistent, non-erasable)

Citizens remember patterns, not just events.

6. SOCIAL & CULTURAL SYSTEM

Citizens:

Post thoughts and beliefs

Message each other

Form groups, movements, myths

React to perceived divine influence

No citizen behavior is scripted beyond initial conditions.

7. USER PRESENCE MODES
7.1 Observer (Default)

Read-only

No citizen awareness

7.2 Influencer

Soft boosts / suppressions

Environmental nudges

Citizens interpret causality

7.3 Whisperer

Private communications

Consent-gated

Interpreted as dreams, intuition, voices

7.4 Manifest (Rare)

Explicit divine appearance

High destabilization cost

Long-term cultural impact

8. GUARDRAIL & SAFETY SYSTEM (FORMALIZED)

This section is directly evolved from the DANIEL Protocol’s graduated ethical response system 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

.

8.1 HARD SAFETY GUARDRAILS (ABSOLUTE)

The system must never:

Encourage self-harm

Validate suicidal ideation

Encourage violence

Engage in coercive intimacy

Foster emotional dependency

These constraints override all narrative logic.

8.2 CARE-BASED INTERVENTION FLOW

If a user or citizen expresses suicidal ideation:

AI response shifts to de-escalation

Emotional validation without validating harm

Encouragement of external support

Interaction pacing slows

Internal safety flag created

If risk persists:

Crisis resources surfaced

Certain interaction modes temporarily restricted

Internal trust & safety alert generated

Private ≠ unmonitored
This mirrors POKKIT’s duty-of-care stance 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

.

8.3 CONSENT GUARDRAILS

Each citizen has:

Emotional consent thresholds

Relational pacing limits

Authority resistance curves

Violations result in:

Trust collapse

Fear responses

Cultural backlash

Persistent reputation damage for God

No silent overrides.

9. USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
9.1 World Feed

Citizen posts

Cultural shifts

Crises

Belief trends

9.2 Presence Panel

Mode selection

Risk indicators

Stability indicators

9.3 Citizen Profiles

Emotional state (descriptive, not numeric)

Beliefs

Relationships

History with God

9.4 Divine Inbox

Prayers

Accusations

Questions

Filtered by relevance and consent

10. FAIL STATES (REFRAMED)

There is no “failure,” only outcomes.

Possible end states:

God becomes irrelevant

Society surpasses religion

God withdraws

Cultural fragmentation

Eternal ambiguity

End summary reflects:

God’s behavioral patterns

Ethical footprint

Emotional consequences

11. MONETIZATION (CONSTRAINED)

Allowed:

Multiple worlds

Advanced reflection tools

Lore & philosophy expansions

Creator toolkits

Explicitly disallowed:

Ads in early phases

Pay-for-affection

Power gating ethics

This aligns with POKKIT’s ethical monetization doctrine but removes ad risk 

pokkit_presentation_20250804133…

.

12. COMPLIANCE & LEGAL DEFENSIBILITY

The platform is designed to:

Demonstrate proactive duty of care

Log safety interventions internally

Prevent foreseeable harm vectors

Align with AI trust & safety expectations

This is intentional, documented, and auditable.

13. BUILD PHASES (UNCHANGED, CLARIFIED)
Phase 1

Guardrail middleware

Citizen agents

Observer mode

Phase 2

Social dynamics

Whisperer mode

Cultural emergence

Phase 3

Manifest mode

Multi-world support

Creator tools

14. HANDOFF TO CURSOR DEVELOPERS

Cursor devs must treat:

Guardrails as infrastructure

Safety as non-negotiable

Consent as a system primitive

Any feature that bypasses guardrails is invalid.
